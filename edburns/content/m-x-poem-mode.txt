M-x Poem-Mode -- by Ed Burns (1994)

                            I like emacs,
                           a large amount.
                             I run emacs
                         on my Sparc account.

                             I run emacs
                         each and every day.
                         And if you asked me,
                           I'd have to say,

                            as editors go,
                            emacs is king.
                           By running emacs
                         you can do anything.

                  You can cruise the World Wide Web,
                           create C++ code
                           read Usenet news
                    edit your thesis in TeX mode!

                          email is a breeze
                          in the mode of VM
                       I swear I'll never ever
                          use "mail" again.

                            Learning emacs
                         can take some time.
                       Those control characters
                       sure can make one whine.

                             But when all
                         the learning's done,
                     you'll find your emacs world
                           has just begun.
