Faces 2.0, The Complete Reference</a>.  Published: November 2nd 2009
  ISBN: 9780071625104  <br />

JSF 2.0 was a blockbuster release and introduced a large number of new
and powerful features.  This book was much more than an update of the
first edition.  More than two thirds of the content was brand new,
documenting all of the new features.

  February 21st 2008 ISBN: 9780071490832 <br />

This book is a collection of incisive interviews I conducted with some
of the top practicing programmers of the day.  I tried to discover and
share the secrets of their professional success in technical, business,
career, and personal domains.  I continue to evolve this idea
as <a href="devrel.html">a lecture</a>, including new interviews with an
expanding cadre of contemporary rock star programmers.

<p>Technical Blog</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://ridingthecrest.com/blog/">http://ridingthecrest.com/blog/</a> <br />

Starting in 2004, My blog covers topics of interest to the practicing
programmer, mostly in Java, but also with higher level topics such as
REST, architecture, and industry analysis.
