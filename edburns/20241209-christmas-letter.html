last I wrote, Logan, who turns 19 this Christmas, was the big man on
campus at Bear Lake Elementary.  He is starting another journey
toward being BMOC again as a first year student in the honors program
in the Electrical Engineering program at University of Florida in
Gainesville. He graduated as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT9cxsAFf54">salutatorian</a>
from his class at Crooms Academy of IT. As in my last update, he
still excels at math and has added so many other aspects of
excellence I can’t list them all. He is active in campus life as a
contributor to the <a href="https://ufsolargators.org/">Solar Gators
</a>electric vehicle team and a member of the <a href="https://ieee.ece.ufl.edu/">IEEE
student chapter</a>. He is adjusting well to campus life and loves
his apartment near campus. The diligence imparted by his mother is
paying dividends, I continue to be impressed by his self-motivated
work ethic.</font></font></p>

is now a senior at University of Central Florida and has achieved

As if that was not enough, he co-founded, and <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oneethos-acquires-artificial-intelligence-startup-140000959.html">subsequently
sold</a>, a Artificial Intelligence company to a local fintech. As

for me, I am very fortunate that my 22 year involvement with Java
technology opened the door to a position at Microsoft in June of
2019. I continue to work with Java on Microsoft Azure and manage an
excellent team in Shanghai, China. This position affords me the
opportunity to visit the team regularly and I’ve had the pleasure
four times since starting. I hope to continue providing value to
Microsoft shareholders as long as I can.</font></font></p>
