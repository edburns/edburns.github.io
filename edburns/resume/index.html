organization dedicated to producing world-class software through efficient 
application of software engineering practices.<BR></P>
<H3><STRONG>EXPERIENCE</STRONG></H3>

<p>I have developed my career with proven distinctions in three related
core competencies: <a href="#developer">software

  ISBN: 9780071625104  <br />

JSF 2.0 was a blockbuster release and introduced a large number of new

  February 21st 2008 ISBN: 9780071490832 <br />

This book is a collection of incisive interviews I conducted with some
of the top practicing programmers of the day.  I tried to discover and
share the secrets of their professional success in technical, business,
career, and personal domains.  I continue to evolve this idea
as <a href="devrel.html">a lecture</a>, including new interviews with an
expanding cadre of contemporary rock star programmers.
