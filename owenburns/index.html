            <h2>About me</h2>

            <p>I am a 3<sup>rd</sup> year undergraduate in the honors
                Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program at
                University of Central Florida. This page makes the
                case that I would be a great internship hire and
                provides links to my CV. Expand each section for more.</p>

                    <p>Here are a few points about my hands-on
                        experience with machine learning and natural
                        language processing.</p>

                </summary>
                
                
                <p>I first became interested in machine learning
                    during the pandemic, during my junior and senior
                    year of high school. At that time, I took several
                    online courses to get familiar with the subject
                    and subsequently conducted my AP research project
                    on reinforcement learning. Since then, I have
                    delivered several professional solutions for a
                    number of different employers across several
                    domains, as detailed here.</p>

                <ul>

                    <li><p>At UCF I joined the <a
                                                   href="https://www.cs.ucf.edu/research/natural-language-processing-group/">deep
                        learning lab</a> and my primary project was
                        developing a self supervised reinforcement
                        learning architecture to improve the performance
                        and RL agents at knowledge graph query
                        answering. The idea is that before training with
                        RL, we train the agent with SL by calculating all
                        the possible routes from the agent's current
                        position to the answer and taking the cross
                        entropy between the agent's probability
                        distribution and a perfect probability
                        distribution that representing all actions that
                        can lead to the right answer having equal
                        probability and all others having zero. The agent
                        was able to outperform SOTA (at the time) and
                        achieved better performance than the same agent
                        without the SL pretraining. Theoretically, this
                        pre training helped the agent by exposing them to
                        knowledge of more possible paths than it would
                        learn on its own, helping it generalize to harder
                        queries. I also wrote several sections of the
                        paper, available for download at
                        &lt;<a href="20230801-F3-750-T-ASL-10090-2023_Proof_hi.pdf">https://bit.ly/kg-reasoning-rl</a>&gt;.
                    </p></li>
                    
                    <li><p>At <a href="https://www.vian.ai/">VianAI</a>
                        I was tasked with creating an RL agent that
                        could, based on the amount of money currently
                        in an ATM and other factors such as the time
                        of year, determine when and how much to refill
                        the ATM, taking into account when workers were
                        on holiday and unable to make the
                        replenishment. I built the environment and
                        network architecture in PyTorch and was able
                        to achieve solid performance by the end of the
                        summer. </p></li>

                    <li><p>As a side job, I assisted one of my
                        research professor's colleagues with a project
                        to predict which route a trash truck should
                        take to most efficiently and safely visit all
                        the houses on its assigned route. The project
                        is on pause for the summer, but I developed a
                        graph convolutional network and environment
                        using openstreetmap to solve the problem. </p></li>
                    
                    <li><p>I was hired by <a href="https://forthepeople.com/">Morgan and Morgan</a> after
                        placing second in their AI/LLM hackathon to expand
                        their AI capabilities. In my time there I
                        developed the backend of a chatbot using langchain
                        to put the documents associated with a legal case
                        in pinecone and then answer questions about
                        them. After that was complete, I was tasked with
                        developing a model that can predict the value of
                        legal cases; I have finished collecting and
                        cleaning the dataset and have trained the model to
                        accuracy within 5 figures, though I am aiming for
                        4. </p></li>

                    <li><p>At my own startup, <a href="https://toolcharm.com/">ToolCharm</a>,
                        my business partner and I have developed a
                        chatbot that can perform actions in shopify,
                        twilio, and google drive using our own fork of
                        LangChain that we have adapted for the
                        purpose. We will be continuing to add new
                        services, which will be easy thanks to a
                        proprietary graph encoding for SaaS
                        documentation that we developed which allows
                        the agent to quickly learn how to perform a
                        task.

                <p>In addition to my work at UCF's deep learning and

                    internship at the University of Tennessee this summer
                    where I developed a quantum convolutional network to
                    predict whether an ecg record was indicative of an
                    arrhythmia. The poster from that internship can be downloaded from

                         I implemented Aydin Ayanzadeh's methodology
                         as a ROS node on our test cars to detect the
                         lanes on a running track and calculate how
                         far off the car was from the centerline
                         between the two lanes. For details on the
                         methodology, see

I generally also use Sklearn during feature selection when I'm performing recursive feature elimination as it's so easy to just use model.fit instead of writing out a training loop for that part of the process. I have used PyTorch and numpy almost daily for around a year and a half.
